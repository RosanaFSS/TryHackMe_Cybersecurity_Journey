<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h3>What We've Covered</h3>
<p>In this room, we explored the basics of cryptography and its role in protecting confidentiality—one of the three pillars of the CIA Triad. We covered the core ideas:<br>

- Plaintext is what you can read. Ciphertext is scrambled gibberish.<br>
- A key is the secret that controls scrambling and unscrambling.<br>
- An algorithm is the public method for using the key.<br>

We looked at two flavours of encryption:<br>

- Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It's fast and efficient, but you need a secure way to share that key. We used the Caesar cipher to see how this works.<br>
- Asymmetric encryption uses two linked keys: a public key that anyone can use and a private key that only one person keeps. This solves the key distribution problem and powers the initial handshake for HTTPS connections.<br>

We also saw how real systems combine both types:<br>

- Asymmetric encryption sets up a shared key at the start.<br>
- Symmetric encryption handles the actual data because it's faster.<br>

That combo is what protects your passwords, banking details, and messages when you see that padlock in your browser.<br>

Cryptography is one of the most critical tools in a defender's arsenal. It protects confidentiality and integrity, and it's the backbone of almost every secure system you use online. But it's not magic. It's one layer in a much bigger security picture that includes:<br>

- Strong password practices.<br>
- Secure key storage.<br>
- User awareness and training.<br>
- Regular software updates.<br>
- Monitoring and incident response.<br>

Understanding how crypto works and where it can fail helps you think more carefully about those other layers.</p>
