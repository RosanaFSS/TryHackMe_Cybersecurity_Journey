<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p>Great job, Defender! In this room, you explored the fundamentals of defensive security, learned how to identify and understand client infrastructure, and adopted a defender mindset to anticipate how attacks may occur. By thinking like both an attacker and a defender, you examined how security controls can be applied across multiple layers to reduce risk and protect important systems.</p>

<h3>Key Terminology</h3>
<p>

- Blue Team: A group of cyber security defenders tasked with protecting systems and responding to threats<br>
- Client Infrastructure: The networks, servers, devices, and applications belonging to an organization that need protection<br>
- Visibility: The ability to see and monitor activity across systems to spot potential issues<br>
- Threat: A potential danger, such as a hacker or malware, that could harm systems or data<br>
- Prevention: Stopping threats before they can cause harm by blocking, restricting, or reducing opportunities for attack<br>
- Detection: The process of identifying threats or suspicious activity in networks and systems<br>
- Mitigation: Actions taken to reduce or stop the impact of a threat once it's identified<br>
- Risk: The likelihood and potential impact of a threat successfully harming an organization</p>

<h3>What Is Next</h3>
<p>Starting out in cyber security can feel overwhelming. There are many tools and concepts to understand, and it's not always clear where to focus first. By completing this room and the Pre Security path, you've taken an important step toward understanding how defenders protect systems, data, and users in real-world environments.

The key to continuing is to build gradually. As you progress with TryHackMe, you'll gain the foundational knowledge needed to deepen your learning in both defensive and offensive security. Understanding how systems are protected, monitored, and defended will strengthen your ability to detect attacks as well as your awareness of how attackers operate. Over time, this balanced approach will help you build the skills and confidence needed to move toward a variety of roles within cyber security.</p>
The answer is simpler than it seems: break the field down, choose an area of cyber security that interests you, and practice regularly using hands-on exercises. You may find that the offensive techniques learned in this room are what interest you most. By building a habit of learning a little each day on TryHackMe, you’ll steadily develop the skills and confidence needed to move toward your first role in the industry.</p>

<h4>Potential Career Opportunities</h4>
<p>In this room, you covered a high-level introduction to identifying and protecting client infrastructure. Defensive cyber security offers a wide range of career opportunities for those interested in blue teaming, from monitoring systems and analyzing logs to responding to incidents and improving security controls. Below are a few common career paths you may be interested in if you decide to pursue defensive security as your area of focus.<br>

- Security Operations Center (SOC): Monitors networks and systems to detect and investigate suspicious activity or security alerts<br>
- Threat Intelligence: Researches current threats, attackers, and trends to help organizations prepare and defend against potential attacks<br>
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR): Investigates security incidents to understand how an attack happened, and contains the threat to restore affected systems</p>

<h4>Further Learning</h4>
<p>This room marks the end of the Pre Security learning path. If you have completed all of the rooms in this path, congratulations on reaching an important milestone in your cyber security journey! You can now claim your Pre Security certificate, which reflects your foundational understanding of core security concepts.<br>

From here, you can explore additional learning paths that align with your interests, whether that's offense, defense, or building broader foundations.<br>
