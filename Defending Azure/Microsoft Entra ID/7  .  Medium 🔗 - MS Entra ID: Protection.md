<h2>Task 1 . Introduction to Identity Protection</h2>
<br>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<p>1.1. <em>What type of risks can be detected, investigated, and remediated by Microsoft Entra Identity Protection?</em><br>
<code>identity-based</code></p>

<p>1.2. <em>If a risky sign-in activity is detected for a user, what is the user considered to be?</em><br>
<code>risky</code></p>

<p>1.3. <em>The indication of how likely a sign-in activity will be compromised is called?</em><br>
<code>risk level</code></p>

<p>1.4. <em>During a user sign-in, risk-based Conditional Access policies kick in and ask the user to reset their password. Once the user resets the password, this risk is remediated. What kind of remediation is this?</em><br>

<code>3</code></p>

<p>2.3. <em>Are there more sign-in risk detections than user risk detections? (Yea/Nay)</em><br>
<code>Yea</code></p>

<p>2.4. <em>Which detection will be triggered if a user denies MFA because the sign-in request didn't come from the authorized user?</em><br>
<code>User reported suspicious activity</code></p>

<h2>Task 3 . Risky Users and Sign-ins</h2>
<br>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<p>4.1. <em>What can administrators configure to allow access to a risky user?</em><br>
<code>password change</code></p>

<p>4.2. <em>On the other hand, auto-remediation action for risky sign-ins is to require what?</em><br>
<code>Multifactor authentication</code></p>

<p>4.3. <em>Can Risk-based policies be enforced on user risk and sign-in risk levels? (Yea/Nay)</em><br>
<code>Yea</code></p>

<br>
<h2>Task 5 . Investigate and Remediate Risk</h2>
<br>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<h2>Task 7 . Lab-07: Simulate Risk Detections</h2>
<h3>Microsoft Entra ID Lab Rules</h3>
<p>

- You are being assigned a privileged role, so be careful not to break things which will affect your other colleagues. <br>
- Labs are shared cloud environments for all learners in your organization.<br>
- You might be able to see other learners' lab assets, such as directory objects (users, groups, and more).<br>
- Only modify or delete the lab assets you own or create in the lab environment.<br>

<h3>Lab scenario</h3>
<p>You have been tasked with simulating a pre-determined risk detection type:<br>

- Anonymous IP address</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>For this lab, you will need a Tor Browser to simulate sign-in from an anonymous IP address.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Your company wants to simulate some risk detections to better understand how they behave. As part of this simulation exercise, you need to choose a risk detection type and perform the steps to trigger it.</p>


<h3>Role</h3>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-reader">Security Reader</a></p>

<p>Access your lab by clicking the Cloud Details button below in conjunction with the lab instructions from Task 6:<br>

[  Cloud Details  ]</p>


<h3>Step 1: Setup Prerequisite</h3>
<p>

- Log in to the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> with your lab credentials<br>
- Download and install  <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser</a> (<strong>Note</strong>: If your organization restricts the use of the Tor browser, you can use the AttackBox by pressing Start AttackBox on top of the page or use your personal VM.)</p>

<h3>Step 2: Access to myApps portal for testing</h3>
<p>

- Launch your Tor browser and navigate to <a href="https://myapps.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a><br>
- Enter your lab credentials to sign in<br>
- The screen below might look different to your user</p>

<p>
  
- Head back to the Microsoft Entra admin center on your default browser<br>
- Navigate to <code>Protection</code> > <code>Identity Protection</code> > <code>Risky sign-ins</code><br>
- The sign-in should appear within 10 - 15 minutes.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f159d0e9-47a8-450d-b761-959f1c3dca85"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.<br></h6

<p>Here is an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-simulate-risk">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> on how to trigger some other <strong>Identity Protection risk detections</strong>. Feel free to try them out on your own time. However, please bear in mind that some of these risk detections need an <strong>identity behaviour</strong> learning period of 7 days/30 days in order to create a baseline.</p>

<p><em>Answer the question below</em></p>

<p>7.1. <em>I understand how to simulate some of the Identity Protection risk detections. I am ready for the MS Entra ID: Governance room.</em><br>
