<h2>Task 1 . Introduction to Identity Management</h2>
<h3>What Is Privileged Identity Management (PIM)?</h3>
<p>Microsoft Entra <strong>Privileged Identity Management (PIM)</strong> is a service that enables the <strong>discovery</strong>, <strong>control</strong>, and <strong>monitoring</strong> of <strong>privileged assignments</strong> in Microsoft Entra, Azure, and other Microsoft services such as Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Intune. PIM allows configuring <strong>just-in-time</strong> access and setting up relevant settings for privileged roles so that users will have to activate and be approved for relevant roles every time they need to use the role.</p>

<h3>Why Use PIM?</h3>
<p>Using <strong>Privileged Identity Management</strong> (which will be called PIM for the rest of this room) helps organizations reduce their <strong>Identity Attack Surface</strong>strong> by managing and discovering privileged roles and monitoring excessive resource permissions. By doing so, organizations reduce the risk of a malicious actor getting access and an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource.</p>

<h3>What Are the Key Features of PIM?</h3>
<p>Microsoft Entra PIM has several key features that help achieve Zero Trust and Least Privilege best practices.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="800px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a97622b3-5110-4c7c-a176-2122dfc2f179"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<p>Using the above features, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator">Privileged Role Administrators</a> can be on top of the requested and standing privileged access on the directory and Azure resources.</p>

<h3>Who Can Use PIM?</h3>
<p>In Microsoft Entra, only <strong>Privileged Role Administrator (PRA)</strong>strong> or <strong>Global Administrator</strong>strong> roles can <strong>manage</strong>strong> assignments for other administrators. On the other hand, all the below roles can <strong>view</strong>strong> the assignments in PIM:<br>

- <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator">Global Administrator</a><br>
- <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator">Security Administrator</a><br>
- <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader">Global Reader</a><br>
- <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader">Security Reader</a><br>

Now that we have scratched the surface of PIM, we will next see some of the terminology and the concept of the four A's: <strong>Assign</strong>, <strong>Activate</strong>, <strong>Approve</strong>, and <strong>Audit</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<p>1.1. <em>Which service helps to reduce standing privileged access by discovering, controlling, and monitoring privileged assignments?</em><br>
<code>Privileged Identity Management</code></p>

<p>1.2. <em>Which feature gives users temporary permissions to perform privileged tasks?</em><br>
<code>just-in-time access</code></p>

<p>1.3. <em>Can a Security Administrator manage PIM role assignments? (Yea/Nay)</em><br>
<code>Nay</code></p>

<br>
<h2>Task 2 . Privileged Identity Management: Four A´s</h2>
<p>Different types of users, such as administrators and members, will interact with PIM differently. That's why, before we discuss how things work in PIM, we need to understand certain PIM-specific concepts around role assignments. Let's start with the <strong>Four A's</strong>.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="800px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1e88a32-6202-4d98-9b7e-a08c28c3cefc"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<h3>Assign</h3>
<p>This is simply creating user assignments for Microsoft Entra roles to ensure that users have Just-in-Time (JIT) access to privileged roles. Let's try to elaborate on this with some questions:<br>

- Who can assign privileged roles to other users?<br><strong>Privileged Role Administrator (PRA)</strong> or <strong>Global Administrator</strong>.<br>
- To whom are these privileged roles assigned?<br>Regular users who need to perform privileged tasks in a JIT manner.<br>
- How long will the users have privileged roles assigned to themselves?<br>For a limited time, such as 2hrs/4hrs/8hrs, defined by the administrator.</p>

<h3>Activate</h3>
<p>Following an assignment, certain users know that as part of their job, they may need to perform some privileged tasks occasionally. For instance:<br>

- A <strong>Developer Lead</strong> may need to manage applications registered in the directory for the apps the developer team is creating. Hence, an <strong>Application Administrator</strong> role will be required to perform these tasks for a limited time.<br>
- Similarly, a <strong>Human Resources (HR)</strong> admin may need to manage some users and groups. In this case, the HR admin will elevate access to the User Administrator role using PIM, again for a limited time.<br>

The idea is that users <strong>eligible</strong> for certain privileged roles can <strong>activate</strong> their roles in a self-service fashion. We will discuss the eligibility concept further. Administrators can also directly activate the eligible roles if needed.</p>

<h3>Approve</h3>
<p>With PIM, roles can be configured to require <strong>approval for activation, and one or multiple users or groups can be chosen</strong> as <strong>delegated approvers</strong>. Delegated approvers have 24 hours to approve requests. If a request is not approved within 24 hours, the eligible user must re-submit a new request. The 24-hour approval time window is not configurable.</p>

<h3>Audit</h3>
<p>Audit history can be used to see all role assignments and activations within the past 30 days for all privileged roles. It will list all the details on:<br>

- Who requested the privileged assignment?<br>
- Who granted the privileged assignment?<br>
- What was the action taken?<br>
- What was the primary target, i.e., the privileged role assigned?</p>

<h4>Assignment Types</h4>

<h6 align="center"><img width="400px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa7c327-4a3a-48ce-8dc3-55466be33c90"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<p>In Microsoft Entra PIM, mainly there are two types of assignments:<br>

- <strong>Eligible</strong>: The user is eligible for the assigned privileged role. However, the user needs to activate the role to perform privileged tasks.<br>For example, an HR admin is eligible for the User Administrator role. After activating it, the HR admin gets the User Administrator role.<br>
- <strong>Active</strong>: The user's privileged role assignment is directly activated. i.e., no need for further activation.<br>

In addition, start and end dates can be set for the above assignment types, which gives the following four assignment types in total:<br>

- Eligible (Permanent)<br>
- Active (Active)<br>
- Time-bound (Eligible)<br>
- Time-bound (Active)</p>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<p>2.1. <em>Besides the Global Administrator, which other role can assign privileged roles to other users?</em><br>
<code>Privileged Role Administrator</code></p>

<p>2.2. <em>What do eligible users have to do in order to take on their privileged roles? </em><br>
<code>activate</code></p>

<br>
<h2>Task 3 . Privileged Identity Management: <code>Assign</code></h2>
<p>Now, let's explore the details of each of the four "A's", starting with "Assign". As mentioned earlier, either the Privileged Role Administrator (PRA) or the Global Administrator can assign roles. It's a security best practice to check the least privileged roles by task before assigning roles to users.</p>

<h3>PIM Scenario</h3>
<p>Let's consider a scenario where, as part of the new employee onboarding process, the HR admin needs to manage users and groups for a limited time, specifically during the first week of the month. To complete the required onboarding tasks, the HR admin would need a privileged role, which is User Administrator.</p>

<h4>How To Assign a Privileged Role?</h4>

<p>A Privileged Role Administrator in the Microsoft Entra admin center can go to the following:<br>

Identity Governance > Privileged Identity Management > Manage > Microsoft Entra roles<br

Here, we start with assigning eligibility.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="800px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48ddce18-973f-4582-aabc-76afbdd2ae6d"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<p>We select Add Assignments and then select the privileged role, User Administrator, to make it eligible for the selected user, i.e., HR admin.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="400px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8886a0b-31c4-4f0a-b9b7-c323f9022706"><br><br>
                   <img width="600px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f077d3ce-c8ca-4760-afeb-b69f45b68a0b"><br>This images and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<p>Based on the scenario, we want to make this privileged role "eligible" for the HR Admin; hence, the Assignment type will be eligible. As for the duration of eligibility, let's assume that validity till March 31st is sufficient. This means the assignment will be a time-bound assignment, not a permanent one.<br>

Note: Active assignments don't require the user to perform any action to use the role. Users assigned as active have the privileged role assigned to them at all times.</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="400px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eee28b5-0dda-472a-8447-90425daa3732"><br><br>
                   <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/431ca1c6-b547-4275-b10c-d810f69dda7a"><br>This images and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>

<p>Now that the privileged role eligibility is assigned, let's check the assignment details.<br>

Identity Governance > Privileged Identity Management > Manage > Microsoft Entra roles > Assignments</p>

<h6 align="center"><img width="800px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70952048-e5f6-4e45-af5b-495451d50f43"><br>This image and all the theoretical content of the present article is TryHackMe´s property.</h6>


<p>Administrators can see and manage all Eligible, Active, and Expired assignments here.<br>

That would be all that is needed to make a user eligible for a privileged role. Next, let's change perspective and see how the user can activate the eligible role before performing the privileged tasks.</p>

<p><em>Answer the questions below</em></p>

<p>3.1. <em>In privileged identity management, can assignment type be eligible or active? (Yea/Nay)</em><br>
<code>Yea</code></p>

<p>3.2. <em>If a privileged role assignment is <strong>not</strong> made <strong>permanent</strong>strong>, i.e., <strong>start</strong>strong> and <strong>end</strong> date/times provided, then this assignment is?</em><br>
<code>time-bound</code></p>
