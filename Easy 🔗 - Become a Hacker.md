<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p>In this room, you learned about the role of ethical hackers, became familiar with key terminology and hacking methodologies, and gained hands-on experience using real security tools used by professional red teamers to help secure a web application.</p>

<h3>Key Terminology</h3>
<p>

- Scope: The exact systems and actions allowed during a security test<br>
- Vulnerability: A hidden weakness in a system that an attacker could use to break in<br>
- Exploit: A method or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability<br>
- Enumeration: Collecting details about a system, users, and services to find weak points<br>
- Credentials: Login details such as usernames and passwords that unlock access<br>
- Authentication: The step that checks if someone or something is really who they claim to be when logging in<br>
- Dictionary attack: Trying a predefined wordlist to guess a password or username</p>

<h3>What Is Next</h3>
<p></p>Learning a new discipline can be intimidating, and it’s often hard to know where to start. After completing this room and the Pre Security path, you’ve built a solid foundation for your cyber security learning journey, and now you may be thinking about how to continue in a manageable, sustainable way.<br>

The answer is simpler than it seems: break the field down, choose an area of cyber security that interests you, and practice regularly using hands-on exercises. You may find that the offensive techniques learned in this room are what interest you most. By building a habit of learning a little each day on TryHackMe, you’ll steadily develop the skills and confidence needed to move toward your first role in the industry.</p>

<h4>Potential Career Opportunities</h4>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering what career opportunities exist for hackers. Let’s review a few common roles where these skills are applied in professional, real-world settings.<br>

- Penetration Tester/Ethical Hacker: Focuses on safely exploring vulnerabilities within a defined scope<br>
- Vulnerability Researcher: Identify and validate undiscovered weaknesses in software and hardware<br>
- Red Team Operator: Simulate real-world adversaries to test an organization's detection, response, and defensive capabilities</p>

<h4>Further Learning</h4>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about what other opportunities there are within the broad field of cyber security, you are encouraged to walk through Become a Defender, which will outline the defensive techniques used by professionals to secure an organization's infrastructure. From there, you can explore additional learning paths that align with your interests, whether that’s offense, defense, or building broader foundations.<br>

- Cyber Security 101<br>
- Jr Penetration Tester<br>
- SOC Level 1<br>
